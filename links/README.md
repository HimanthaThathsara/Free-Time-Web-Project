# Per-folder Link Templates

This directory contains per-folder markdown files you can edit to add a target URL for each folder. Each file is a small template; replace <ADD_URL_HERE> with the URL you want.

Example template below (you can copy this into new files named after the folder):

## 3D Rotating Slider Animation

Target URL: <ADD_URL_HERE>

Replace the angle brackets with the link to the demo or page for this component.

Tip: If you provide me the mapping of folder -> URL, I can update all these files (or the main PROJECT_LINKS.md) for you in one commit.
